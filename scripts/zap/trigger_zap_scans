    # GENERAL NOTE
    # The zap scan scripts assume it is working from ${WORKSPACE} (/workspace/app)
    # Paths are set based on this. For example. If the /workspace/app contains
    # a repo called 'myzap_repo' which contains the zap scripts, the path you specify
    # for the set up steps below should begin with 'myzap_repo/'. 
    # The scripts will automatically prefix these paths with ${WORKSPACE}.
    # By default when an async task starts up, it copies the content of your repo into /workspace/app/one-pipeline-config-repo
    # During the setup you must switch to ${WORKSPACE} and you can specify 'one-pipeline-config-repo' when setting the paths
    # The reason to specify the paths this way, is to allow a git clone command to run, cloning an additional repo into ${WORKSPACE}
    # The user might wish to have a common repo which holds the core zap scripts
    # And have specific scripts in the application repo

    # CLONE REPO
    # Example common repo containing the core zap scripts
    # GIT_TOKEN="$(get_env git-token "")" where git-token is a pipeline param set in the UI
    # git clone "https://${GIT_TOKEN}@github.ibm.com/huayuenh/myzap_repo"
    # set_env "zap-core-scripts" "myzap_repo/scripts/zap/zap_core"

    # For deploying zap to a cluster an api-key and cluster name is required

    # can be updated in the zap-core/setup script. Search for IBMCLOUD_IKS_CLUSTER_NAME
